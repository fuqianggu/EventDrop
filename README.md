# EventDrop
This repository contains code for the IJCAI 2021 paper "EventDrop: Data Augmentation for Event-based Learning". In this paper, we introduce EventDrop, a new method for
augmenting asynchronous event data to improve the generalization of deep models. By dropping events selected with various strategies, we are able to increase the diversity of training data (e.g., to simulate various levels of occlusion). From a practical perspective, EventDrop is simple to implement and computationally low-cost. Experiments
on two event datasets (N-Caltech101 and N-Cars) demonstrate that EventDrop can significantly improve the generalization performance across a variety of deep networks.
